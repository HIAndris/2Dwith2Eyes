- Uses two camera modules (OV7670)
- Maps a horizontal slice of 3D space in real time
- Effectively simulates **2D perception with two eyes** in a 3D environment

Potential applications include:
- Obstacle detection
- Image processing
- Spatial awareness
- Demonstrations for STEM education

## ⚙️ Technical Overview

- Hardware: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1
- Dual OV7670 camera modules
- Development environment: PlatformIO with CLion
- Programming language: C/C++
